            <p>Fairlayer is a decentralized payment network that combines instant transfers and stability of traditional finance with security of a blockchain.</p>

            <p>It is composed of two loosely coupled layers: globally shared compact "onchain" state and node-to-node "offchain" protocol. It repurposes the blockchain's from daily payments to work as insurance and settlement layer and crypto court for disputes, moving all payments to be processed instantly and cheaply through non-custodial hubs. The platform supports any type of a fungible numerical asset: from stable fiat currencies to security tokens and stock.</p>

            <p><strong>Everyone is a Full Node</strong> is our #1 security principle. Full nodes of most blockchains become unusable on consumer devices when they get popular, that's why everyone moves to insecure light clients. That will never happen to Fairlayer - our full node is built to routinely run on consumer hardware - laptops and mobile phones - no matter how many people are using it, 1 million or 10 billions. The wallet processes very few insurance rebalances and requires negligible resources and bandwidth.</p>

            <p><strong>Extended Lightning Network</strong>. Fairlayer implements XLN scaling concept - we've fixed <a href="https://medium.com/fairlayer/xln-extended-lightning-network-80fa7acf80f3">original Lightning's capacity/liquidity issues with uninsured balances</a>. Also, we implemented payment channel functionality natively in the blockchain itself, instead of running it on top of a virtual machine opcodes. This dramatically reduces the complexity of payment channels and makes the codebase easier to audit and maintain.</p>
